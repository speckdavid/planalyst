** TODO setData does not exist update does not exist either
   [2021-02-05 Fr 16:21]
   [[file:~/IMP/growt/data-structures/base_linear_iterator.hpp::{%20_ptr->setData(value);%20}]]

** TODO the complex slots fingerprint is bad when doing circular mapping
   [2021-02-04 Do 18:59]
   [[file:~/IMP/growt/data-structures/element_types/complex_slot.hpp][file:~/IMP/growt/data-structures/element_types/complex_slot.hpp]]

** TODO make a find script for the utils library this would produce an error if git submodule update was not called
   [2021-02-03 Mi 15:14]
   [[file:~/IMP/growt/data-structures/element_types/simple_slot.hpp::\//%20***%20SFINAE%20based%20helper%20for%20atomic%20updates%20**********************************]]

** TODO construct all tables with some kind of table config stuff
   [2020-10-15 Do 01:23]
   [[file:~/IMP/growt/data-structures/base_linear.hpp::using%20needs_referential_integrity%20=%20int;]]

** TODO if slots need cleanup, do that in base table destructor but only if the element is not marked
   [2020-10-15 Do 01:01]
   [[file:~/IMP/growt/data-structures/base_linear.hpp::class%20A%20=%20std::allocator<typename%20E::atomic_slot_type>>]]
   for non-marking tables, we could still do something in the
   atomic_mark routine, that tells them not to cleanup (i.e. remove ptr?)

** TODO use improved allocators with per thread free lists
   [2020-10-14 Mi 19:08]
   [[file:~/IMP/growt/data-structures/element_types/complex_slot.hpp::static%20value_type*%20allocate()]]

** TODO change update and delete capabilities
   [2020-10-08 Thu 13:14]
   [[file:~/IMP/growt/data-structures/element_types/complex_element.hpp::bool%20atomic_delete(const%20complex_element%20&%20expected);]]
for now I removed update and delete from the new complex data types

** TODO we have to pass the hash value to the comparison for fingerprints
   [2020-10-08 Thu 13:13]
   [[file:~/IMP/growt/data-structures/element_types/complex_element.hpp::bool%20compare_key(const%20key_type%20&%20k)%20const;]]

** TODO
   [2020-10-08 Thu 13:12]
   [[file:~/IMP/growt/data-structures/element_types/markableelement.h::static%20constexpr%20unsigned%20long%20long%20MARKED_BIT%20=%201ull%20<<%2063;]]
