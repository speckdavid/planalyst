Compilation:
   Choose between M, Mp and MpC by commenting/uncommenting the lines for
   VERSION and EXECUTABLE in Makefile
   make

We recommend usign the the planner first with default settings ( = only the input files
on the command line). They often work best.

The command line for the executables consist of a number of options and
the names of input file names. With an empty command line you get the list
of options together with information on the default configuration.

MpC often consumes all available memory, so it is critical to make sure that
-m N flag is set sensibly. Too high values lead to paging, and too low values
may mean that plans are not found. The default can be adjusted in main.c as
the default value of the flagMemoryLimit variable.

The DIMACS output file obtained with the -O option includes symbol table
information, to map each propositional variable to a time point and
action or state variable name. The Perl script KISSATSOLVE uses this
information to call the KisSAT solver to solve and output a solution
(in case the formula is satisfiable.) The Perl scrip SHOWDIMACS outputs
the DIMACS CNF file with literals in symbolic form.
